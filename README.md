Dojo 1.x modern themes

### Getting Started

1. Install globally with npm `stylus` and `grunt-cli`.
2. Run `grunt bower-install-simple` to install Dojo and Dijit dependencies.
3. Run `grunt` to open the Dijit theme tester.

### Contributing New Themes

For general contributing guidelines see [Dojo's Contributing Guildlines](https://github.com/dojo/dojo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Adding a new theme:

1. Create a uniquely named directory in `dijit/themes`, also being the name of the theme.
2. Add the directory to `.gitignore`.
3. Add [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) tasks for the theme to `Gruntfile.js`.

## Themes

### Flat Theme

A flat theme for Dojo Dijit. A complimentary [dgrid skin](https://github.com/SitePen/dgrid/pull/1174) is also being developed.

This theme is currently in **development**. Contributions welcome.

Run `grunt flat` to compile CSS and open Flat Theme's test application for development. The Flat Theme Test app does not require the dependencies and can be run as is with any web server.

To use Flat Theme right away simply copy the `flat` directory and its contents to a location in your app, add/import `flat.css` and add `class="flat"` to the body tag.
